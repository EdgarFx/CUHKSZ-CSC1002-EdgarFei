# DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
## 1. Design
### 1a. Overview
The program is an interactive snake game. The game is composed of 3 objects: a snake, a monster and food items represented by a set of numbers from 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game is the initial interface. The user can see a short introduction on this screen. Then, the user can click the screen to start the game. What's more, The user is allowed to move the snake with the keyboard using the four directional bottoms (up, down, right and left). Since that, the timer will start timing and the monster will start moving towards the snake’s head. The goal of the game is to maneuver the snake within the game area to consume all the food items while avoiding head-on collision with the monster.As each food item is consumed, the snake grows with its body lengthened in size equal to the value of the number being passed.

### 1b. Data Model
#### 1. snake including the tail
I use the turtle model to draw the head of the snake and its tail. I also use two lists **snake_x** and **snake_y** to store the coordinates of the snake including the tail (It means the coordinates of all the squares of the snake). What's more, I use a integer to represent the number of the tails which are being extended. 
#### 2. food items
I use the turtle model to draw the food items. And then, I use a list called **food_items** to store all the turtles which draw the food items. I also use a list called **eaten** to store the information about whether the food items have been eaten. (The values in this list are Boolean).

### 1c. Program Structure
> Reminder: The text is a brief description, the program structure diagram is more detailed and shows the main structure of the program.

* The first part is to set the initial interface. The following diagram shows the structure of this part.

* Last but not least, after invoke the snake_move function, the structure of code which implement the movement of the monster is like this:

**Description**: (The bold parts are functions and the italicized parts are variables)  
In this program, we first invoke **set_screen** function to set the initial interface of the snake game. In this function, we create a variable *s* which represent the main screen. Then we create another variable *subtitles* to represent the subtitles of the game. And then, we invoke **set_board**, **set_contact**, **set_time** and **set_motion** functions to build the gaming board of the game.

Then, we invoke **snake** and **monster** functions to create two turtle objects to draw the snake and monster.

What's more, I use **onclick** method to allow the user to click the screen to start the game, the **start_game** function will be invoked at this time.

In start_game function, **food**, **set_key**, **run_time**, **run_motion** functions will be invoked first to set food items, keys, update time, motion status at the top of the board respectively.

And then, we invoke the **snake_move** function. In this function, we first invoke **is_win**, **is_lose** function to check whether we win or not. Then we invoke **is_edge** function to check whether the snake touch the edge of the board or not. And we also invoke **has_eaten** function to check whether a food item has been eaten or not. Then, if *game_status* = 1 or *now_direction* = 'stop', we use **ontimer** function to invoke **snake_move** again. Else, we invoke **extend** or **normal_move** functions depends on the value of *generated_tails*. Last, We use **ontimer** to invoke **snake_move** function.

Last, we invoke the **monster_move** function. We also need to check whether we have win the game or not first. If not, we invoke **change_m_direction** function to implement the change of the direction of the monster. Then we use **stamp**, **setheading**, **forward** and **clearstamps** methods to implement the movement of the monster. In the end, we use **ontimer** to invoke **moster_move** again and again.

### 1d. Processing Logic
#### i. The logic used to motion the snake and monster.
To move the snake and monster, I mainly use two methods of turtle model. The first is turtle.stamp(), and the other one is turtle.clearstamps(1). The stamp method can copy the turtle at the same position, and then I move the head of the snake (or move the monster) once. Then, I use the clearstamps to clear the earliest of the stamps I have created before. For the snake, it is the end of its tail, for monster, It is the last position of it. And I use ontimer method to repeat the process again and again. Therefore, we can implement the movement of the snake and monster.

For the monster, what's more, is the algorithm to move toward the snake's head. I compare the x distance and y distance between the head of the snake and the monster. Then, if the speed of the monster is larger than that of the snake, it will go through the longer side to shorten the distance, otherwise it will go through the shorter side.

#### ii. The logic used to expand the snake tail
I use a variable *generated_tails* to store how many squares I need to add (The default value is 5). First, I still use the method stamp to implement the expand of the tail. Then, I move the head of the snake. I also subtract 1 for generated_tails so that the squares will be added until the generated_tails is 0 (it means that the tail is not expanding right now). I put this function in the function **snake_move** and use ontimer method to invoke **snake_move** again and again. Therefore, if generated_tails > 0, the **expand** function will be invoked again and again.

#### iii. the logic used to detect body contact between the snake and the monster
I define a function **check_if_contact** to detect the body contact between the snake and the monster. When I expand the tail or just normally move the snake, I put the coordinates of the body of the snake into two list *snake_x* and *snake_y*. So I can check for all coordinates in these two list, whether the x or y distance between monster and the body of the snake is larger than 20 or not. If not, the variable *contact* which store the number of contact will add 1. Therefore, I can detect the body contact.
